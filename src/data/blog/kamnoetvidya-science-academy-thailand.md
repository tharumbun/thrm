This modern academy in Thailand is grooming the next generation of the nation's most gifted minds. Only 70 students are accepted from 5000 applicants after a series of tests. Classes are named after the four houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and quotes from figures like Galileo Galilei and Steve Jobs are used.

Located in the jungle on the outskirts of Rayong, the school aims to help talented kids discover, make, and invent for the next century. Currently, it is not open to foreign students.

The Kamnoetvidya Science Academy is interesting due to its focus on grooming the next generation of the nation's most gifted minds, as well as its selective admission process, unique class names, and inspirational quotes. Also, its location in the jungle on the outskirts of Rayong adds to its uniqueness and potential for fostering creativity and innovation among its students.

The Kamnoetvidya Science Academy (KVIS) is a prestigious science and mathematics boarding school located in Rayong, Thailand. The academy is known for its rigorous academic curriculum and its focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. KVIS aims to nurture the intellectual curiosity and critical thinking skills of its students, preparing them for higher education and careers in scientific fields.

Established in 2013, KVIS is a partnership between the PTT Public Company Limited (a Thai multinational petroleum and petrochemical company) and the Ministry of Education. The academy operates under the Office of the Basic Education Commission and follows the Thai national curriculum, enhanced with additional science and math courses.

KVIS offers a competitive admission process and accepts students from across Thailand who demonstrate exceptional aptitude and interest in STEM subjects. The academy provides a holistic learning environment, combining rigorous academics with a variety of extracurricular activities, research opportunities, and international collaborations.

The facilities at KVIS are state-of-the-art, including well-equipped science and computer laboratories, classrooms, and dormitories for residential students.
