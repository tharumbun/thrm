  My first haiku
---

Winter is coming A cool breeze not frozen snow in the heart of Penh

...

Sunday morning rain

Hand-making a cup of coffee

The sound of its drop and drip

...

Tweets haikus

of Cambodia

...

Horribly hurt

beaten dogs

began to bark

...

The trapped train

began to roll

waiting for nobody

...

Today my son

Tom turns two

Lego as gift

...

Gloomy cloud

Waiting for

A shroud of dark night

...

A cup of coffee

poured to refuel

train of thought

...

Sunless Saturday

Pray for peace

In the thin air

...

Frenzy Friday

Feel as I may

Float through life

...

Morning mist

This Thursday

Sipping tea

...

Kid on the pitch

We dine in The Shop

Illuminated by light bulb

...

This is my first attempt to experiment with composing this after spending an enjoyable evening with my family at a nice place, The Shop, where my son, Tom, played on the grass.

Now stunned silence

Which was once broken

In a city of two tales

...

Thank goodness

it’s fabulously

a fried day

...
