  Arc is is my new new default web browser
---

This week I started using a new web browser called Arc. It is still in beta, but quite stable. I signed up for the invite-only list in March, but didn't have a chance to really use it. Last week, a geeky friend shared the link to the waitlist, and I immediately checked my email inbox to grab the link to download it (Mac only for now).

After a day, Arc has become my default browser. Well, three other browsers I use every day are Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera (built-in free VPN).

Two things I like about Arc: first, its super minimalistic user interface (distraction-free in a world of digital distractions). And second, it comes with a built-in ad-blocking feature, which is great for blocking annoying ads.

What's in a Name?
> In Mathematics, an “arc” is a smooth curve joining two endpoints. In general, an arc is one of the portions of a circle. It is basically a part of the circumference of a circle. Arc is a part of a curve. An arc can be a portion of some other curved shapes like an ellipse but mostly refers to a circle.


Anyway, have you ever heard of Netscape Navigator?
