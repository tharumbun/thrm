### How to use ChatGPT in Cambodia

I understand that you are interested in using ChatGPT in Cambodia, but the registration process is currently not available for users in your region. However, I can provide some suggestions to help you overcome this obstacle.

Firstly, as you mentioned, you can use a VPN to access the registration page and bypass some of the initial steps. However, keep in mind that you will still need to verify your account with a US phone number, which brings me to my second point.

[SMSPool](https://smspool.net/?refferal=ik98WZByww) as a service can provide you with a US phone number for verification purposes. \[While this may work, it is important to note that using third-party services like this can be risky, and it may not be a reliable solution.\]

Another option you may consider is reaching out to someone you know in the USA who can assist you in the account setup process. They can provide you with a legitimate US phone number for verification, and they may also be able to help you navigate any other potential obstacles in the registration process.

Lastly, it's important to remember that some global internet services may take longer to roll out their services in certain regions, including Cambodia. While this can be frustrating, it's not uncommon, and it may be worth keeping an eye on future updates to see if ChatGPT becomes available in your region.

Overall, while there are some workarounds to try, it may be best to seek assistance from someone in the USA or wait for updates on when ChatGPT will be available in Cambodia.

In late December, the New York Times reported that "A New Chat Bot Is a 'Code Red' for Google's Search Business".

With massive amount of \[ongoing\] trained data, Artificial Intelligence is now the beginning of how we interact with world’s knowledge.

### ChatGPT is a machine learning giant beast

ChatGPT was launched on December the 1st last year. Even until early January 2023, the popular and powerful AI chat service has not fully opened to users worldwide.

Everyday on Twitter, you can see that people keep talking about how great ChatGPT is and what it can do in many fields. Scientist and author Gary Marcus wrote a bold headline "[What to Expect When You’re Expecting … GPT-4](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting)" on his Substack newsletter The Road to AI We Can Trust.

In this blog post, you'll find something I found interesting when interacting with this charming ChatGPT.

After signing in, the first dialog message I got is:

**This is a free research preview.** Our goal is to get external feedback in order to improve our systems and make them safer. While we have safeguards in place, the system may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information and produce offensive or biased content. It is not intended to give advice.

- Conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.
- Please don't share any sensitive information in your conversations.
- This system is optimized for dialogue. Let us know if a particular response was good or unhelpful.

Some use cases I've tried:

- Use ChatGPT for English grammar check

As a writer, the tool is powerful to refine and improve the content quality.

ChatGPT cannot predict future events when asking for an overview of a business climate in Cambodia in 2023. I also asked the AI agent about top news stories of the day from Cambodia. In a response, it says it cannot crawl the world wide web. And its knowledge is based on "information that was current up until 2021."

UK deputy ambassador to Cambodia, Marc Thayre, asked me in a tweet conversation that “I’d be interested to hear how you find AI dealing with Khmer language and Khmer culture. Is it inherently biased towards a western philosophy and English language?” I will have to find out more.
