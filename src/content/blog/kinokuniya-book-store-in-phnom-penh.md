I came across this Japanese book about Honda Super Cub at Kinokuniya book store in AEON mega mall in Phnom Penh. It's one of my favorite book stores in Cambodia.

There is also this book I found interesting: NHUM - Recipes from a Cambodian Kitchen. The author is a Cambodian chef from the nation's new generation. Known as Chef Nak, she's one of Cambodia’s first female celebrity chefs to place Cambodian food to the international stage.


Last year, I wrote a long piece about Asia's Lasting Love Affair with Honda Super Cub. You can find it kiripost dot com.
