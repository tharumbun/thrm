---
This morning I read this story on Wired written by [Sandra Upson](https://www.wired.com/author/sandra-upson/). It's [a fascinating story](https://www.wired.com/story/lee-holloway-devastating-decline-brilliant-young-coder/): Lee Holloway programmed internet security firm Cloudflare into being. Then he became apathetic, distant, and unpredictable—for a long time, no one could make sense of it.

The story of Lee Holloway, a co-founder of Cloudflare, takes a poignant turn, showcasing the fragility of the human mind and the importance of early diagnosis and resilience.

Lee Holloway was a young coding prodigy with unmatched creativity and problem-solving skills. Along with his colleagues, he co-founded Cloudflare, a tech startup that would later become a global leader in internet security and performance. His brilliance and dedication were instrumental in shaping the company's success.

As Cloudflare continued to flourish, Lee's life took an unexpected and heart-wrenching turn. In his early thirties, Lee started exhibiting concerning symptoms—a decline in cognitive abilities, apathy, and unpredictability. The once vibrant personality became clouded, leaving his loved ones bewildered and searching for answers.

After a series of tests, Lee Holloway was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a rare and progressive brain disorder that has no cure. The news was devastating, and Lee's condition continued to worsen over time. Despite the challenges, he remained resolute, determined to keep fighting.

Lee's story underscores the critical importance of early diagnosis and treatment for FTD. While there are medications that can slow the disease's progression if caught early, many individuals with FTD often receive a diagnosis when the illness is already advanced. Lee's journey serves as a poignant reminder of the need for increased awareness and proactive healthcare measures.

Amidst the hardships, Lee Holloway's determination to contribute to Cloudflare remained unyielding. Despite the debilitating effects of FTD, he persevered and continued working until the very end. His dedication inspired colleagues and friends, demonstrating the remarkable strength of the human spirit even in the face of adversity.

Holloway's story highlights the significance of early detection and intervention in managing devastating conditions like FTD. Regular medical check-ups and seeking professional evaluation for concerning symptoms can make a profound difference.

Lee's journey reminds us that the human mind, with all its brilliance, is also vulnerable. However, it is equally resilient, capable of enduring challenges and persevering through adversity.

Lee's unwavering commitment to his work and life, despite the odds stacked against him, is a powerful testament to the strength of the human spirit. His determination to leave a lasting impact serves as an inspiration to never lose hope, even in the darkest of times.
