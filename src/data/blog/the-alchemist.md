  The Alchemist is a story about following your dreams
---

Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is a fable about a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to fulfill his "Personal Legend," a concept referring to his deepest desire and life's purpose. This beautiful story begins with Santiago having a recurring dream of treasure near the Egyptian pyramids. He consults with a fortune teller and a wise king who both nudge him to pursue this dream.

Santiago sells his sheep and sets sail for Africa. Throughout his travels, he faces many challenges â€“ from being robbed to working menial jobs. He encounters a variety of people who become his mentors, including an alchemist and a crystal merchant. Each mentor teaches him valuable life lessons that help him on his journey.

The Alchemist is a story about following your dreams, overcoming obstacles, and listening to the signs of the universe. It explores themes of destiny, love, and the importance of listening to one's heart. While the book features elements of fantasy and allegory, it's a story about self-discovery and the transformative power of pursuing your goals.

Interestingly, I read this book some time after my son, who already enjoyed it on the Kindle e-reader.
