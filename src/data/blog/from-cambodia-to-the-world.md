(Verse 2) From tech to culture, he writes with a flair His words are like magic, taking us there To the markets and the schools, to the villages and more Tharum Bun's blog is like a window to the core

(Chorus) Tharum Bun, a blogger with a heart He's telling stories that set us apart From the temples of Angkor to the streets of Phnom Penh He's sharing his world with us, again and again

(Bridge) He's more than just a blogger, he's a guide and a friend He's showing us the way, and helping us comprehend The beauty of his country, the stories that we need Tharum Bun, you're a treasure, a Cambodian breed
