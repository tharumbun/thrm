### The Edge in Business

In today’s fast-paced world, modern media companies embrace immediacy over accuracy, quantity over quality. Too often, to publish news content, most news outlets opt for numbers and metrics. Just like the rest of the world, Southeast Asia and Cambodia need more quality journalism than ever and a place to publish that journalism.

Original, quality, and compelling business news stories are essential and invaluable for this and next generation readers.
