Starlink is a satellite internet service that is currently available in select countries. It is not yet available in Cambodia. However, SpaceX, the company that owns Starlink, has said that it plans to expand the service to Cambodia in 2023.

There are a few reasons why Starlink is not yet available in Cambodia. First, SpaceX needs to obtain regulatory approval from the Cambodian government. Second, SpaceX needs to deploy more satellites in order to provide coverage to Cambodia.

Once SpaceX obtains regulatory approval and deploys more satellites, Starlink will be available in Cambodia. This will provide Cambodians with access to high-speed internet, which will have a positive impact on the country's economy and education system.

Here are some of the benefits of Starlink internet in Cambodia:

High-speed internet: Starlink can provide speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, which is much faster than traditional internet services in Cambodia.
Reliable internet: Starlink is a satellite internet service, which means that it is not affected by weather or terrain. This makes it a reliable option for people who live in rural areas or who have unreliable internet service.
Affordable internet: Starlink is a relatively affordable option for high-speed internet. The monthly subscription fee is $99, and there is a one-time equipment fee of $499.
Overall, Starlink is a promising new internet service that has the potential to transform the internet landscape in Cambodia.

Starlink broadband service, powered by modern satellites in low orbit, provides users with high-speed internet. Recently, after Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister asked the billionaire SpaceX CEO for help via Twitter, Starlink has emerged as a new alternative to fiber-optic internet. With ongoing fighting in Ukrainian cities, there are concerns about potential cyberattacks on critical internet infrastructure, which could hinder the flow of news out of the country and make it harder for people to reach their loved ones," wrote Mitchell Clark and Loren Grush on The Verge.

Starlink, an ambitious internet-from-space initiative engineered by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, began development in 2015 and exited its beta phase in late 2021. It is currently selling internet connections to nearly everyone on Earth except for the North and South Poles. Elon Musk has stated that Starlink will be available worldwide by August 2023.

As of early 2022, the growing network of low-earth orbit satellites services the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand. However, to go global, SpaceX needs at least 10,000 satellites in orbit, and currently, only about 20% of them are in place.

Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, announced at the Mobile World Congress in June 2022 that Starlink would be available worldwide (excluding the North and South Poles) starting in August 2023, pending regional regulatory approval. According to the official Starlink website, the service is designed for areas with unreliable or non-existent connectivity and is being used globally to access education, health services, and to support communication during natural disasters.

Starlink currently offers two service packages. The basic package provides download speeds of 100-200 Mb/s and latency as low as 20ms in most locations, while the premium package offers higher speeds of 150-500 Mb/s.

In other news, China's GalaxySpace launched its first low-orbit internet constellation for testing in March 2023.
