If technology were meant to be solving our humanity problems, what if artificial intelligence (AI) will solve some of the most challenging issues facing people in a country like Cambodia?

And what are those issues? Let’s think about about these:

- Fake news
- Biased  and not so accurate information
- Better quality information and content from the locals

Previously, I wrote about using [ChatGPT in Cambodia](https://tharum.com/blog/open-ai-chatgpt-from-cambodia/).

I think AI has the potential to bring numerous benefits to a country like Cambodia. Some of the key benefits include:

**Improved efficiency**

AI-powered technologies can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time and resources that can be redirected towards more strategic initiatives.

**Better decision-making?**

AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data, making predictions and helping businesses and organizations make more informed decisions.

**Enhanced customer service**

AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide quick and accurate responses to customer queries, improving the overall customer experience.

**Improved healthcare**

AI can help with medical diagnosis, drug development, and medical research, leading to better health outcomes for Cambodians.

**Increased productivity**

AI can help businesses and organizations automate tasks, allowing employees to focus on more complex, value-adding activities.

**Economic growth**

The implementation of AI can drive innovation and increase productivity, leading to economic growth for Cambodia.

In an op-ed in February, Richard Yim, CEO of Quantum Engineering and Manufacturing, wrote AI in Cambodia: Challenges, Opportunities, and the Inevitable](https://medium.com/@richardpyim/ai-in-cambodia-challenges-opportunities-and-the-inevitable-fdc6c41786eb). I suggest that you should read his insights into this topic.

**Here are five key takeaways from Richard's take on the AI and Cambodia:**

1. AI infrastructure is critical for the creation and implementation of AI systems, and it includes hardware, software, and data management tools.
2. The availability of data is essential for the progress of AI, but it is costly and raises privacy and ethical concerns. Synthetic data may be used to overcome these challenges.
3. AI has significant potential in the corporate world, such as in automating processes and decision-making and innovating existing goods and services. However, businesses face challenges in finding qualified personnel and addressing ethical and privacy issues.
4. Cambodia's healthcare, education, and financial sectors may benefit significantly from AI, such as in medical diagnosis and enhancing education quality and availability.
5. Developing a comprehensive strategy for investing in and using AI can help Cambodia take advantage of its potential and address the challenges.

is a report on the results of a survey of the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the education sector in Cambodia. The survey was conducted in 2022 and covered a sample of 1,000 schools across the country.


**AI Landscape in Cambodia: Current Status and Future Trends**

In May 2023, Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology & Innovation published "[AI Landscape in Cambodia: Current Status and Future Trends](https://misti.gov.kh/public/file/202305301685426285.pdf)".

The report finds that the use of ICTs in Cambodian schools is still relatively low. Only 25% of schools have access to the internet, and only 10% of teachers use ICTs in their teaching. However, the report also finds that there is a growing demand for ICTs in education, and that schools are increasingly using ICTs to improve teaching and learning.

The report makes a number of recommendations to improve the use of ICTs in education in Cambodia. These recommendations include:

Increasing access to the internet in schools
Providing training for teachers on how to use ICTs in teaching
Developing ICT-based learning resources
Creating a national ICT policy for education
The report concludes that the use of ICTs has the potential to significantly improve the quality of education in Cambodia. However, the report also notes that there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize this potential.

Here are some additional details from the report:

The survey found that the most common use of ICTs in schools is for administrative tasks, such as managing student records and communicating with parents.
ICTs are also used for teaching and learning, but to a lesser extent. The most common use of ICTs for teaching and learning is for providing access to information and resources.
The report found that there are a number of factors that are hindering the use of ICTs in schools, including:
Lack of access to the internet
Lack of training for teachers
Lack of ICT-based learning resources
Lack of a national ICT policy for education
The report concludes that the use of ICTs has the potential to significantly improve the quality of education in Cambodia. However, the report also notes that there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize this potential.
